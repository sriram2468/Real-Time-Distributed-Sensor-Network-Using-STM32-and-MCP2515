# Real-Time-Distributed-Sensor-Network-Using-STM32-and-MCP2515
This project develops a real-time sensor data acquisition system using STM32 and MCP2515. Sensor data is processed by STM32 and transmitted over the CAN bus using the MCP2515 controller, ensuring reliable and noise-resistant communication for industrial and automotive applications.
